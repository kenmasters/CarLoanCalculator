# Take Home Assignment - Laravel / PHP

The task solves a real-world problem related to car loans by calculating interest cost for a given
loan amount (principal).

## Brief

Write an API-driven application that consumes a principal amount (original amount borrowed) from
an HTML form and outputs the interest cost asynchronously (without page reload).

You can calculate using the formula I = P x R x T, where:
- "I" is the Interest Cost (OUTPUT)
- "P" is Principal, or the original amount borrowed (INPUT)
- "R" is the Rate of Interest, expressed as a decimal (Use 6% annual interest)
- "T" is Term, or length of the loan (5 Years)

Note: For the equation to be accurate, you've got to make sure that your rate and term are both being
measured by the same time intervals. For instance, if you're using an annualized interest rate, you must
calculate your term in years.
